I needed to change my tyres for winter. However my mechanic had all possible dates booked. So I decided - let's hack it and let's periodically check whether there is a new free slot in the weeks that I'm interested in. 
So I analyzed the website, extracted the table, found a way to read it using requests and analyze with BeautifulSoup and extract free slots. 
Then I thought - so if I run it on RaspberryPi, I need to have an info on my smartphone so that I can book that slot quickly. 
Telegram bots came to the rescue and I created a really simple bot which sends me a message whenever there is a slot.
